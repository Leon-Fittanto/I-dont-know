   <center> <p>Hello, and welcome to my home page. As you may have guessed from the heading, my name is Leon Fittanto. For fun, and hopefully for work, I enjoy working with data (both coding and analysis). I have experience using R, SAS, Python, and SQL, and am teaching myself HTML, CSS, and Javascript (hence the creation of this website).I am also a music performance student at UIC, majoring in Percussion.</p>
    <br>On a side note, please excuse the state of this webpage as I learn what I'm doing lol. <br>  
   <P>This page will eventually include samples of my coding, data analysis, music, and writing.</P>
